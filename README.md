🚦 Delhi Traffic & Accident Risk Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

The Delhi Traffic & Accident Risk Analysis Dashboard is an end-to-end data analytics project designed to analyze traffic accident patterns and identify high-risk zones across Delhi.
The project transforms raw accident and traffic-related data into meaningful insights that can help improve road safety, optimize traffic management, and support smart city planning.

🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:

Identify accident-prone areas in Delhi
Analyze time-based accident trends
Study the impact of weather conditions
Compare accient risk across road types
Understand the role of traffic density
Generate actionable safety insights

🧠 Problem Statement

Delhi experiences a high number of road accidents due to increasing vehicle density, congestion, and environmental factors like fog and rain.
There is a need for a data-driven approach to:
Detect accident hotspots
Understand risk patterns
Support preventive decision-making
This dashboard helps visualize accident risks and contributing factors using analytical techniques.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes traffic and accident-related attributes such as:
Location
Time of Accident
Weather Conditions
Road Type
Traffic Density
Number of Vehicles Involved
Casualties
Accident Severity

⚙️ Project Workflow
This is a complete End-to-End Data Analytics Project.

1️⃣ Data Collection

Simulated traffic & accident data inspired by real-world urban patterns.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Performed using Python & Excel:
Removed duplicates
Handled missing values
Standardized formats

3️⃣ Data Transformation

Created:
Risk Scores
Peak Hour Indicators
Severity Levels
Zone Classification

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed patterns based on:
Time
Location
Weather
Road Type
Traffic Density

5️⃣ Dashboard Development

Interactive dashboard built using Power BI.

📊 Dashboard Features
Accident Hotspot Identification
Time-Based Trend Analysis
Weather Impact Study
Road Type Risk Comparison
Traffic Density Analysis
Severity Distribution
KPI Metrics:
Total Accidents
Fatal Accidents
High-Risk Zones
Peak Accident Hours

🔍 Key Insights

Peak accidents occur during evening hours
Fog and rain increase accident severity
Highways show fewer but more fatal accidents
Urban roads show frequent minor accidents
Low traffic density leads to higher severity due to speed

🟢 Risk Classification

Zones are categorized as:
High Risk
Medium Risk
Low Risk
Based on:
Frequency
Severity
Traffic Conditions

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Data Cleaning)
Excel (Data Preparation)
Power BI (Visualization)
DAX (Calculated KPIs)

💡 Business Recommendations
Install speed monitoring in low-density zones
Improve lighting in urban accident-prone areas
Introduce fog alerts in winter
Monitor peak-hour traffic hotspots

📈 Outcome

This dashboard enables:
Data-driven traffic monitoring
Risk identification
Better urban planning
Improved road safety strategies

🚀 Future Scope

Integration with live traffic APIs
Machine learning-based accident prediction
Real-time monitoring dashboard
