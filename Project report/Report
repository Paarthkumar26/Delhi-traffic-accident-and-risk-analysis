📊 End-to-End Project Report
Delhi Traffic & Accident Risk Analysis Dashboard

1️⃣ Project Title

Delhi Traffic and Accident Risk Analysis Using Data Analytics

2️⃣ Problem Statement

Road accidents are one of the major public safety concerns in Delhi.
With increasing population, vehicle density, and urban congestion, accident risks vary across:
Locations
Time
Weather
Road types
Traffic density
However, authorities often lack data-driven insights to:
ent-prone zones
Understand cases

Predict high-risk conditions

👉 This project aims to analyze traffic & accident patterns to support smart decision-making for safer roads.

3️⃣ Project Objective

The main goals were:
Identify accident hotspots 🚨
Analyze time-based accident patterns ⏰
Understand weather impact 🌧️
Study vehicle involvement 🚗
Detect high-risk zones 📍

Provide insights for prevention ✅

4️⃣ Data Collection

Data was collected from simulated and public-inspired sources including:
Traffic density records
Accident reports
Road type data
Weather conditions
Time & location logs
Dataset fields included:
Attribute	Description
Location	Area in Delhi
Time	Hour of accident
Weather	Clear / Rain / Fog
Road Type	Highway / Urban / Residential
Traffic Density	Low / Medium / High
Vehicles Involved	Count
Casualties	Injuries / Deaths
Accident Severity	Minor / Major / Fatal

5️⃣ Data Cleaning

Performed using  Excel
Handled:
Missing location values
Duplicate entries
ect time formats
Standardized weather categories
Converted severity into numeric risk levels

6️⃣ Data Transformation
Created new analytical fields:
Risk Score
Peak Hour Indicator
Weather Risk Index
Zone Classification
Accident Frequency

7️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:
Which areas report highest accidents?
When do accidents occur most?
Does weather influence severity?
Are highways more dangerous?
Does traffic density affect risk?

8️⃣ Dashboard Development
Built using Power BI

Key Visuals Created:

✔️ Accident Hotspot Map
✔️ Time-Based Trend Analysis
✔️ Weather Impact Chart
✔️ Road Type Risk Comparison
✔️ Traffic Density vs Severity
✔️ KPI Cards:

Total Accidents

Fatal Cases

High-Risk Zones

Peak Accident Time

9️⃣ Key Insights Generated
🚨 Location-Based

Urban intersections reported the highest accident frequency

High congestion zones showed more severe accidents

⏰ Time-Based

Evening peak hours (6 PM – 9 PM) had maximum accidents
Late-night accidents were fewer but more severe

🌧️ Weather Impact

Rain & fog increased severity
Clear weather had higher volume but lower fatality rate

🛣️ Road Type

Highways → fewer but more fatal accidents
Urban roads → frequent minor accidents

🚦 Traffic Density

High density → more collisions
Low density → higher fatal impact (due to speed)

🔟 Risk Zone Identification

Zones were classified as:

🔴 High Risk

🟠 Medium Risk

🟢 Low Risk

Based on:

Accident frequency

Severity

Traffic load

1️⃣1️⃣ Business Recommendations

✔️ Increase traffic monitoring in hotspot zones
✔️ Install speed cameras on low-density highways
✔️ Deploy fog alerts during winter
✔️ Improve lighting in high-risk urban roads
✔️ Adjust traffic signals in peak hours

1️⃣2️⃣ Outcome

The dashboard enables:

Real-time monitoring
Data-driven planning
Preventive action
Supports:
Smart city initiatives
Road safety programs
Traffic control strategy

1️⃣3️⃣ Tools Used

1️⃣4️⃣ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can transform raw traffic data into actionable insights.

By identifying patterns in accident occurrences, authorities can:

➡️ Improve road safety
➡️ Reduce fatalities
➡️ Optimize traffic systems
